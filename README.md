The task was to create a vanilla JS webpage using no frameworks that allows a user to search for a Pokemon.

// What I've done includes: \\ 

1. Creating an input field for the user to type a name or ID number.
2. Creating a responsive button to enact the function required to pull and return API data.
3. Creating an empty div for dynamic DOM manipulation to display the pokemon's name, image of both the regular and shiny sprites, and the pokemon's typing.
4. Creating an error message to display if the button is pressed without input, or if there is invalid input received (eg. wrong spelling) and therefore a pokemon is unable to be found.
5. Creating a simple yet nicely formatted webpage using CSS, HTML, and JS.

// Based on previous feedback, I have also: \\

1. Double checked with online resources that the webpage colors contrast well for better readability and accessibility.
2. Eliminated spacing within my code to not have nearly as much blank space.
